Shall I compare thee to a summeris day?XThou art more lovely and more temperatenXRough winds do shake the darling buds of MayFXAnd summeris lease hath all too short a dateUXSometime too hot the eye of heaven shinesFXAnd often is his gold complexion dimmAdUXAnd every fair from fair sometime declinesFXBy chance or natureis changing course untrimmAdUXBut thy eternal summer shall not fadeFXNor lose possession of that fair thou owistUXNor shall death brag thou wanderist in his shadeFXWhen in eternal lines to time thou growistnX   So long as men can breathe or eyes can seeFX   So long lives thisF and this gives life to theeH
